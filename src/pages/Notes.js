        Case Study: Enhancing the Notes Screen for VIEW
      </h1>
      <img src={final} />
      <div className="content-block">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The Notes screen is an integral feature used by finance, warehouse,
          and logistics teams within the VIEW platform. It provides a shared
          space for adding critical job-related information, ensuring visibility
          across departments. Despite its importance, user research revealed
          significant challenges: information overload, difficulty locating
          relevant details, and poor visibility of user availability.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This case study delves into the redesign strategy for VIEW‚Äôs Notes
          screen, focusing on addressing user pain points such as cluttered
          organization and inefficient search functionality. By prioritizing a
          more intuitive, user-friendly interface, the redesign aims to boost
          productivity and satisfaction while preserving the core functionality
          users rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
          During usability testing, users described the screen as
          "overwhelming," highlighting the need for a welcoming yet efficient
          redesign. The updated interface seeks to achieve simplicity, clarity,
          and a structured workflow.
        </p>

      <div className="content-block">
        <h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Organization:</strong> Enable users to locate
            information quickly through a more intuitive layout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Semantic Notes:</strong> Introduce note types with specific
            purposes to enhance clarity and relevance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Legibility:</strong> Ensure the interface is
            visually clear and easy to navigate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Availability Visibility:</strong> Provide a clear
            indicator of user availability to streamline communication.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advanced Search and Filtering:</strong> Implement robust
            tools for filtering and searching notes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div className="content-block">
        <h2>Proposed Improvements</h2>
        <h3>1. Note Templates</h3>
        <p>
          Standardized templates for common updates (e.g., shipping issues)
          categorize notes and make them easier to find. Templates reduce
          ambiguity and allow users to quickly identify critical updates.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Whitespace Usage</h3>
        <p>
          Introducing ample whitespace improves readability and reduces visual
          clutter. A cleaner interface makes text-heavy screens more
          approachable and less overwhelming.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Dynamic Sidekick AI Assistant</h3>
        <p>
          The static Sidekick AI was revamped to feel more interactive and
          integrated. Features like proactive suggestions and contextual
          assistance enhance its usefulness.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Progressive Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
          Only the original note is shown by default, with replies hidden unless
          expanded. This approach minimizes cognitive overload while preserving
          access to detailed discussions.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Acknowledgements</h3>
        <p>
          Replacing redundant comments with emoji reactions (e.g., üëç, ‚úÖ)
          streamlines responses. This reduces unnecessary clutter and provides
          quick, clear feedback.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Filtering Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          New filters, such as "read" or "unread," allow users to efficiently
          sort through notes. Customizable filters improve the relevance of
          search results.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Username Highlighting</h3>
        <p>
          Highlighting tagged usernames differentiates them from regular text,
          aiding collaboration. This ensures users can quickly identify who is
          involved in specific updates.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Avatars with Status Indicators</h3>
        <p>
          User avatars now display availability (e.g., "in office" or "out of
          office"). This feature helps direct communication to the appropriate
          person, reducing missed updates.

            detailed exploration as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
